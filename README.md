# GIMCO
This is a code that calculates errors on weak lensing amplitude using Fisher forecast analysis. based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00071
First I upload the original version of my code used to do Fisher analysis in the GIMCO paper, and as next step I try to make the code cleaner and write it in a better way.
